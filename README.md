# Warp Development Assessment

This is a simple weather app that allows users to enter a city name and view basic weather information in real time.

## Design Decisions

- Temperature is displayed in **Â°C** only, as per regional conventions.
- The app uses **server-side rendering** (SSR) via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to demonstrate performance benefits and SSR expertise.
- No third-party libraries were used to showcase clean, minimal Next.js and React usage.
